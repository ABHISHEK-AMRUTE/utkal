# Problem to be solved
The CCTNS portal for submitting online FIR have very cryptic and non-userfriendly UI, it will be difficult for an illitrate to fill every smallest details.
# Solution
  We came up with a solution to make this process just a matter of one click. We will be devloping Virtual Environment in which an animated police officer will be going to interact with the victim/complainer. In this way Filing a FIR is just like watching animated scene, what you have to do is to simply answer the questions asked by police officer and rest process will be taken care by us.  
  The virtual environment can be viewed in <b>Console VR's</b> for more immersive experience.
